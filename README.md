## Description
In this homework assignment I created a Node.Js command line application. The application generates an html that displays the information given. To optimize the application I used Node Jest to test the functions within selecting as a Manager, Engineer, or an Intern. After the tests are run and the user completes the prompts given from the application, an html will display the response to the prompts in a card graphic using bootstrap. 

### Dependencies
The dependencies that I used for this application was inquirer for the question prompt and Jest for the testing.
